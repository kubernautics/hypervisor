## What is it?
Intended for both the new hobby sysadmin and experienced DevOps professional.    
This set of guides & build tools is aimed at the Single Host Laptop/Desktop/Server Development and Education Paradigm and can be expanded upon once the core fundamentals are understood.    
    
By following these guides you will be able to:    
  1. Demostrate the significant potential of reasonably equipped hardware    
  2. Improve your understandng and fluency in fitting common commercial software components together    
  3. Overcome barriers in consuming automation tools to improve your workflow beyond the burden of menial tasks    
    

## Purpose:

Provide a community platform to quickly and seamlessly build high impact education and development environments.    
    
## Inspiration:

The original inspiration for this project came from a desire to have meaningful hands 
on expreince with a platform that represents the leading edge of modern systems engineering 
at scale. This design serves to solve for the frustrations and blockers encountered after endless 
hours of testing different virtual network solutions, architectures, and strategies in 
search of a paradigm that meets a number of criteria included in the following.
    
## Objectives:    
    
#### Architecture -  Must be consistent on:
  + Client Laptops
  + Client Desktops
  + Low cost Home Labs
  + DevOps Lab Servers
  + 100% Virtual Tenants
  + Multi-Host Rack Systems
  + Single Network Interface Devices
    
#### Experience - Must be accessible to:    
  + Easy to setup
  + Logical to comprehend
  + Easy to manage & maintain
  + Capable of multi-host overlays
  + Easy to use behind Wifi connections
  + Capable of nesting multiple layers of networks
  + Eliminate external network or infrastructure requirements
  + Public Services Delivery enablement through low cost public cloud instance
    
#### Result - Must demonstrate success in:
  + Kubernetes
  + Bare Metal Hosts
  + LXD / LXC OS Container Runtimes
  + Physical & Virtual Switching Gear
  + Docker/Podman Application Container OCI Runtimes
  + Libvirt / QEMU / KVM Virtual Machine Environments
